# Area Model Farm

[**Area Model Farm**](https://dunnoconnor.github.io/areamodelfarm/) is an interactive math visual written in JavaScript and HTML5.

## Features
**Area Model Farm** includes two game modes:
- *The Garden* is a visual for multiplying single digit numbers. The first number is represented as the count of rows in a garden bed.  The second number is represented as the count of columns in a garden bed.  The user multiplies the number of rows by columns to find the area of the garden.
- *The Ranch* is a visual for multiplying two digit numbers. The numbers are divided into place values (tens place and ones place) and then presented as four partial areas. The user finds the area of each of four sections and sums them to find the total area.
